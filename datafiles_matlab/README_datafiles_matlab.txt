This "datafiles_matlab" folder contains 6 matlab data files (.mat files):

    model_output_main.mat: output data for the main model simulation
    
    model_output_varyinputstage.mat: output for the model simulations which
      feed in input data at different stages
    
    model_output_varystartyear_i=1.mat: output for the model simulations
      which feed in input data at different stages, and starts the model in
      the first year considered (1991)
    
    model_output_varystartyear_i=2.mat: output for the model simulations
      which feed in input data at different stages, and starts the model in
      the second year considered (1996)
    
    model_output_varystartyear_i=3.mat: output for the model simulations
      which feed in input data at different stages, and starts the model in
      the third year considered (2001)
    
    model_output_varystartyear_i=4.mat: output for the model simulations
      which feed in input data at different stages, and starts the model in
      the fourth year considered (2006)

These files are generated by the file runme_runcode.m in the
    "code_runsimulations" folder.
